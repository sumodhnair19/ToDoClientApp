# Project 1 : ToDoClientApp

Route URL : /todo or default route

The Project consists of the following functionalities :

1) The Client can add a todo either by clicking "Add" or using keystrokes from keyboard.
2) The Client can delete the todo created.
3) The Client can update the todo by clicking on the todo title, the content would then become editable, from where the client can update the changes.
4) The Client can select the todo and move it to the list of completed todos.
5) The todo is preserved in the localStorage.Hence, even if the client refereshes the page, the list would be preserved.


# Project 2 : Find maximum occurence of string in pi

Route URL : /finder

The count of maximum subsequences of '123' would be printed for the corresponding first 100000 digits of PI. Since the data is having lot of digits to handle, so the processing would take some time to fetch results.
In case you want to test the logic , please uncomment the $scope.seq value of 10 digits to get quick results.
