The Project consists of the following functionalities :

1) The Client can add a todo either by clicking "Add" or using keystrokes from keyboard.
2) The Client can delete the todo created.
3) The Client can update the todo by clicking on the todo title, the content would then become editable, from where the client can update the changes.
4) The Client can select the todo and move it to the list of completed todos.
5) The todo is preserved in the localStorage.Hence, even if the client refereshes the page, the list would be preserved.
